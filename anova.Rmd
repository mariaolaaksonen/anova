This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

# Preparations
go to command line and install needed packages:
>> R
>> install.packages("dplyr", "ggplot2", "reshape")

# Load libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
```

# Load data
```{r}
#Change test.csv to the correct filepath and sep to the delimiter used in your data (\t=tab)
brain_df <- read.csv("test.csv", sep = "\t")
melt_brain <- melt(brain_df, id.vars = "patientID") # Change patientID to the name of the ID column in your data
# Check that variable column has the groupings and value the summarized values
glimpse(melt_brain)
```

# Change column names if necessary
```{r}
colnames(melt_brain) <- c("patientID", "variable", "value") # change these to resemble the correct order of your data e.g. if column 1 has measurement values, column 2 IDs anf column 3 group names then this would be c("value", "patientID", "variable")
```

# Transform data
```{r}
df_ordered_brain <- melt_brain %>%
mutate(variable = factor(variable, ordered = TRUE))
glimpse(df_ordered_brain)
```

# Calculate mean and sd
```{r}
df_ordered_brain %>%
	group_by(variable) %>%
	summarise(
		count_poison = n(),
		mean_value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
		sd_value = sd(value, na.rm = TRUE)
	)

```

```{r}
ggplot(df_ordered_brain, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(shape = 15,
        color = "steelblue",
        position = position_jitter(0.21)) +
    theme_classic()
```

# Without jitter
```{r}
ggplot(df_ordered_brain, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_classic()
```

```{r}
anova_one_way <- aov(value~variable, data = df_ordered_brain)
summary(anova_one_way)
```

```{r}
TukeyHSD(anova_one_way)
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
